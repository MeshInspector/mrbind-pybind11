## This is a fork of [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) that builds stable-ABI Python modules

â€” i.e. the resulting modules can run on multiple different Python versions.

### Is this production ready?

Yes! While this still has rought edges, we [are using it in production](https://pypi.org/project/meshlib/).

### How does it work?

The version-dependent code was moved to a tiny shared library. You must build a copy of it for each Python version you want to support (3.8, 3.9, etc), and ship all those with your module.

### How to use?

This isn't header-only unlike the upstream Pybind. You must build the `pybind11nonlimitedapi_stubs` shared library and link your code against it.

You must also build N `pybind11nonlimitedapi_MyLib_3.??` shared libraries, for each Python version you want to support (3.8, 3.9, etc), and distribute them as a part of your wheel. The correct library is selected at runtime.

Replace `MyLib` with the name of your library, using `-DPYBIND11_NONLIMITEDAPI_SUFFIX=MyLib` CMake flag. Since those libraries are not renamed when building a wheel, we must ensure the name is unique to avoid conflicts between different modules using this library.

Your own code needs be built with `-DPy_LIMITED_API=0x030800f0` (or any other value) and `-DPYBIND11_NONLIMITEDAPI_LIB_SUFFIX_FOR_MODULE=MyLib` (this must match the shim library naming, see above).

Then the `pybind11nonlimitedapi_MyLib_3.??` libraries must be distributed in the same directory as the `.pyd`/`.so` modules (or you can set `PYBIND11_NONLIMITEDAPI_SHIM_PATHS_RELATIVE_TO_LIBRARY_DIR` macro to a path relative to the modules, see that macro definition for details).

When baking the modules into a wheel, the `pybind11nonlimitedapi_MyLib_3.??` libraries must stay in the same directory as the modules. They don't get their names mangled.

If you use `delvewheel` on Windows, don't forget to add `--analyze-existing` to process the `pybind11nonlimitedapi_MyLib_3.??` libraries too.
